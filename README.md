Monopoly Version 2

 
For the final version of Monopoly, you will be expanding the base game with some add-ons.  Choose as few or as many as you like – each one completed will add to your overall project score.  Make sure to include a comment or a text file with your submission stating which ones you think you implemented. 

 

Each completed level is worth +5 points to your project score.

·         Cards – Random events trigger when landing on certain spaces.  Both Chance and Community Chest have a set of events that can trigger when the cards are drawn.


o   Level 1 – Implement both Chance and Community Chest cards.  They can be the ‘real’ cards from the game or have effects of your choosing.

 
o   Level 2 – Create a new type of Card that can reside in a player inventory and be used at any point during the player turn.  Effects are of your choosing.

 
·         Houses


o   Level 1 – Allow the player to build houses on each property they own.  Cost of houses and increases to rent are specified by the game.  At this level, any amount of houses (up to four) can be built on any owned property. 


o   Level 2 – Follow the ‘real’ Monopoly house rules.  Houses must be evenly distributed between ‘sets’ of properties. Hotels can be built after maxing out houses on all properties in a set.

 
·         Multiplayer:


o   Level 1 – Add support for up to six players.

 
·         AI:


o   Level 1 – Allow players to be controlled by AI.  The AI can make decisions randomly.


o   Level 2 – Add some intelligence to your AI.  The AI should make buying/selling decisions based on some strategy.


·         Trading:


o   Level 1 – Allow players to trade properties.  Make sure multiple-for-one trades are possible.

 

·         Auctions:

 

o   Level 1 – Implement the ‘property auction’ rules when a player lands on a space but does not wish to purchase it.

 

·         Battle:

 

o   Level 1 – When players land on the same space, implement a simple turn-based battle system.  Base player stats on number of houses and properties owned.  Winner gets X% of the loser’s money.

 

o   Level 2 – Allow players to ‘attack’ owned properties.  This should start a simple battle mini-game.  Difficulty should be based on the defending player’s ‘stats’, as described in LV1.  If the attacker wins, s/he should be allowed to acquire the property for 2x standard cost. 

 

o   Level 3 – Allow players to build a new type of structure on squares – ‘turrets’.  Turrets significantly decrease the chance of losing a property to attack. 

 

·         Doubles:

 
o   Level 1 – Implement the extra turn for rolling doubles and ‘three doubles in a row lands you in jail’ rules.

 

·         Railroad Travel: 

 
o   Level 1 – Allow players that land on railroads to travel to any other owned Railroad instead of rolling.  If you pass Go, do not collect $200.



·         Cheats:


o   Level 1 – Add in a cheats menu to speed up game-play and enable testing of various functions
